      The main purpose of this application was to design a method in which homeless people
      would be able to apply for jobs. Through this system a prospective employee would come up to the kiosk system
      where they could create an account and apply for a job. Employers can then also log in either through the phone
      or the android application. Through this slowly homeless people could get the work and experience they need
      in order to better advance themselves</p>

      <h1 class="card_content_title">Backend</h1>

      <p class="card-text">
          On the backend the project uses the Django Rest Framework in order to do the simple api calls.
          A restful interface was chosen in order to accomodate the use of both the app and the webpage without
          having to configure the data on the backend side to the specific device. In the backend I setup a simple
          token based authentication scheme that would be used to authorize the different users. The authentication
          allowed users to then access the rest of the api calls.
      </p>

      <p class="card-text">
        On the frontend, there was an android application was designed using android studio and the web interface was
        designed using the foundations framework, jquery, and SASS. When designing this system, my team and I chose to
        use the website for the homeless people to use in order to access the jobs available and get local information
        about deals and shelters that are near them. The android application would then be used by the employers in order
        to create new jobs and check the progress of jobs. <br> <br>

        There was then a rating system put in place in order to allow employess to rate employers and employers to rate
        employees. By doing this the system could then allow for employees to rank up and gain more reputation and respect
        for the work that they are doing. Through this they could then build there resume in order to apply for better
        positions. <br><br>


        Finally there would be a financial system set up that would allow for the payments between the employers and
        employees to all be handles in house. This would then allow the program to issue out a debit card that could be
        used by the employer to make all the purchases that they would need. The hope is, with the inclusion of the debit
        card, instead of direct cash, the emplyee is less likely to use the funds for elicit activities. <br><br>

        In the end the goal was to set up a system in which homeless people could build up there reputation and get to
        a better point in their life.
